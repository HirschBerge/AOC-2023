# Day 3!!
## Another buff doge day.
### Part 1
main.rs.bak contains what I was trying to do. It was not 'da wae' my brotha. I *could* have gotten it to work, but at that point, it was 3am and I was fed up.
I believe it's more beneficial to learning to watch through Chris Biscardi's video and follow along.

### Part 2
I will continue with part 2 on my own, going off of the basis to see if I can get that gold star!

Update: Pfft! Yeah right. I was hoping I could just add a few if statements with a bool passed to the function. It was basically a full refactor and I just wasn't following.
He just sped through that shit like the Flash. So I ended up copying and pasting his part 2 and then watching the rest of the video to understand it better.
