# This one was kinda tough

## Part 1 was pretty easy, but part two, I just couldn't.
I was using keys in a HashMap to regex the key to the variable. I had it working until I realized that this problem didn't make sense in context of the "story." Mixed alphabetical numbers and you had to accept BOTH of them!? Preposterous!

Well, that stumped me. When I added hacky shit like `twone` and `sevenine` the real numbers stopped registering!. So since I have nothing to prove, I figured it would be better to see someone's code that actually works and learn from that.

I ended up ~~stealing~~ recreating [WilkoTom's](https://github.com/wilkotom/Aoc2023/blob/main/day01/src/main.rs) method for part 2. Very cool solution. Similar to what I was going for, just... Well with experience.
